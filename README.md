# Flower_Image_Classifier
 * By **Goutam Dadhich**
 
Flower Image Classifier, Build with Pytorch Neural Network

Project for Deep Learning Section of **Machine Learning Introduction with PyTorch Nanodegree** of Udacity.

## Description 
In this project firstly I develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
 * NumPy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Seaborn
 * Pytorch
 * Torchvision
 * Sklearn / scikit-learn

## Code File
Open file jupyter notebook imageclassifierproject.ipynb
