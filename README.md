# Flower_Image_Classifier
 * By **Goutam Dadhich**
 
Flower Image Classifier, Build with Pytorch Neural Network

Project for Deep Learning Section of **Machine Learning Introduction with PyTorch Nanodegree** of Udacity.

## Description 
In this project firstly I develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
 * NumPy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Seaborn
 * Pytorch
 * Torchvision
 * Sklearn / scikit-learn

## Code File
Open file jupyter notebook imageclassifierproject.ipynb

## Files Description
* Image Classifier Project.ipynb It is used to build the model using the jupyter notebook. It can be used independently to see how the model works.
* cat_to_name.json It is used in ipynb and py file to map flower number to flower names.
* train.py It will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.
* predict.py It uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
